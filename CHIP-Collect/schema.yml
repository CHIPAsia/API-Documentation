    # Online Purchases

    ## Prebuilt payment flow — Redirect

    Redirect integration allows running payments using the prebuilt payment flow.

    To accept payments in your application or website via redirect, use `POST /purchases/` request to create the `Purchase` and receive the `checkout_url`. Redirect the customer to the `checkout_url` to enter their card details for processing. After the payment is processed, the system will redirect the customer back to your website (take note of `success_redirect`, `failure_redirect`).

    *You have three options to check payment status:*

    1. Use `success_callback` parameter of the `Purchase` object.

    2. Use `GET /purchases/<purchase_id>/` request.

    3. Set up a Webhook using the Developers section of your account or use Webhook API to listen to `purchase.paid`, or `purchase.payment_failure` event on your server.

    Setting the `skip_capture` flag to `true` allows you to separate the authentication and payment execution steps, allowing you to reserve funds on the customer's card account for some time.

    This flag can also enable preauthorization capability, allowing you to save the card without a financial transaction, if possible.

    If the customer agrees to store his card for future purchases, there will be an option to pay with a single click next time. To enable this, create a `Client` object for each of your clients and provide `client_id` parameter value in your Purchase creation requests.

    To create a Purchase or a BillingTemplate, you must specify the `Brand ID` and `API key`. You can find both in the Developers section of your account.



    ## Custom payment flow — Direct Post

    Direct post integration allows running payments through the custom payment flow.

    To accept payments in your application or website, use `POST /purchases/` request to create a `Purchase`.

    To capture customers card details use an HTML `<form>` hosted on your website with `method="POST"` and `action` pointing to the `direct_post_url` of the transaction.

    You will also need to fill the form with `<input>`'s for the fields with card details. As a result, when a customer submits their card details, it will be posted straight to our system, allowing you to customize the checkout as you wish. At the same time, your PCI DSS requirement is only raised to Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ A-EP), as your system doesn't receive or process card data.

    For more details, see the documentation on Purchase's `direct_post_url` field.

    ### Tokenization & recurring payments

    You can store card tokens and charge the respective cards without user interaction if the payment channel supports tokenization.

    When you pass `remember_card=on` to `direct_post_url`, the respective `Purchase`'s ID will serve as a card token. This initial `Purchase` will have the `is_recurring_token` field set to `true`.

    To charge the tokenized card once again, create a new Purchase and then call the `POST /purchases/{new_purchase_id}/charge/`. In the request body, provide `"recurring_token": "initial_purchase_id"`. When the request succeeds (response code `200`), the new Purchase will become paid. The token will be persisted in the Purchase's recurring_token field.

    Use `"recurring_token": "initial_purchase_id"` in all the upcoming `POST /purchases/{new_purchase_id}/charge/` requests.

    If you wish to delete the recurring token stored for the initial `Purchase`, use the `POST /purchases/{initial_purhcase_id}/delete_recurring_token/` request. Its `is_recurring_token` will reset to `false`. 

    ## Custom payment flow — Server-to-Server

    Server-to-Server ("S2S") integration allows running payments on the server level without direct interaction between the client’s browser or application and API.

    You can build an integration that prevents payers from accessing platform resources directly. In this flow, 3D Secure implementation allows API clients to:

    Check 3D Secure enrolment, and if the card is enrolled, receive ACS URL together with all the necessary params for redirection to ACS (PaReq, MD);
    Redirect the payer to the ACS system of their issuer bank;
    Receive the payer back and execute the authorization with a separate request.

    If the card is not enrolled in 3D Secure, authorization will execute synchronously.

    Please note that 3DSv2 which is now the industry standard is fully supported by the S2S flow. While PaReq/PaRes below are 3DSv1 parameters (replaced by creq/cres in 3DSv2 challenge), in case of 3DSv2 proxy ACS solution (where the system is accepting the cardholder navigation using 3DSv1 flow and is performing all parts of 3DSv2 verification and challenge on behalf of merchant) is implemented to maintain API compatibility for older integrations.

    To accept payments in your application or website via S2S:

    1.  Ensure the Purchase is created as described in Custom payment flow — Direct Post. As per the Purchase's direct_post_url field description, you will need to ensure all the necessary criteria are met, including success_redirect/failure_redirect fields defined for Purchase and set to arbitrary valid URLs (they will not receive any redirects in the S2S scenario);
    2.  Implement the following request in your server code, appending "?s2s=true" to direct_post_url to form the resulting endpoint (you can obtain the S2S token value from your account manager):

            POST {direct_post_url}?s2s=true

        Specify the following headers:

            Content-Type: application/json
            Authorization: Bearer {S2S token}

        In the request body, provide the following data in JSON (you can omit some of the fields, then system will use default values; We recommend providing correct values from the user’s browser as it can affect 3D Secure success rate):

            {
              "cardholder_name": "John Doe",
              "card_number": "4444333322221111",
              "expires": "01/23",
              "cvc": "123",
              "remember_card": "on",
              "remote_ip": "8.8.8.8",
              "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/51.0.2704.103 Safari/537.36",
              "accept_header": "text/html",
              "language": "en-US",
              "java_enabled": false,
              "javascript_enabled": true,
              "color_depth": 24,
              "utc_offset": 0,
              "screen_width": 1920,
              "screen_height": 1080
            }

        |Field name&nbsp;|Required&nbsp;|Validation criteria/remarks&nbsp;|Default value|
        |--- |--- |---|--- |
        |cardholder_name|Y|Latin letters only (space and apostrophe ('), dot (.), dash (-) symbols are also allowed), max 30 characters||
        |card_number|Y|text, digits only, no whitespace, max 19 characters||
        |expires|Y|text in 'MM/YY' format, digits and a slash only (/^\\d{2}\\/\\d{2}$/), max 5 characters||

        |javascript_enabled|N|boolean|true|
        |color_depth|N|integer in 0-255 range|24|
        |utc_offset|N|integer in -32,768 to 32,767 range|0|
        |screen_width|N|integer in uint64 range|1920|
        |screen_height|N|integer in uint64 range|1080|

    3.  If the card is not enrolled in 3S Secure, then a response will contain the field "status" with one of the following values:
    "executed" in case of a successful payment authorization;
    "authorized" in case fund reservation using Purchase.skip_capture was requested;
    "error" in case of an authorization error.

        Example:

            {"status": "executed"}

        You will receive "executed" or "authorized" statuses with a response status code 200 and "error" status - with a status code of 400.

        In all of those cases, it is necessary to set up webhooks for purchase events (`purchase.paid, purchase.payment_failure` at least) to receive further information about the status of the financial transaction.

    4.  If the card is enrolled in 3D Secure, the response will have a status code of 200, the status will be 3DS_required, and the response will contain additional fields:

            {
              "status": "3DS_required",
              "Method": "(POST|GET)",
              "PaReq": "...",
              "MD": "... (can arrive empty)",
              "URL": "http://url.of.acs.bank/",
              "callback_url": "https://..."
            }

        It’s necessary to ensure your client’s browser makes a request with the method specified in `Method` (GET or POST only) to the ACS of issuer bank returned in "URL", including the values of `MD` and `PaReq` as received (use query params in case of GET and request body params in case of POST). Be aware that MD might arrive empty – in that case, you can send it further as an empty string.

        In addition to those, you also **need to include the `TermUrl` parameter** in the client’s browser request, pointing to the URL in your system where the customer’s navigation will be expected. Once the payer approves the transaction, he will be redirected using the POST method to that URL with `MD` and `PaRes` params in the request body.

    5.  Once the client is back to `TermUrl` in your system and you have received the `MD` and `PaRes`, it’s needed to transmit them to the platform to complete the authorization. Send the following request from your server code (no auth headers required):

            POST {callback_url from step 4.}

            Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
            MD={MD received, if any}&PaRes={PaRes received}

        The response will contain the authorization status in JSON format and will be identical to the format described in the previous section.

    ## Testing Integration

    It’s possible to test-drive all checkouts using a test Purchase.

    For a successful payment, you can use the following card numbers:

    *   4444 3333 2222 1111 - non-3D Secure card
    *   5555 5555 5555 4444 - 3D Secure card

    For both cards, please use:

    *   any cardholder name
    *   any expiry larger or equal to the current month/year
    *   CVC = 123

    For a failed payment, please change the CVC or expiration date.

    When using a 3D Secure enrolled card in S2S checkout,  an incorrect CVC will trigger an authorization failure on the S2S callback step (after the customer returns from test ACS). Using a wrong expiry date emulates data validation failure and results in immediate error before that step.

    # Billing

    ## Invoicing

    To send one-off invoices, use `POST /billing/` request. It's similar to `POST /purchases/` except that customers are an array, allowing you to bulk-issue invoices to several customers at once.

    To send invoices using a template, use a separate `POST /billing_templates/` request (without `clients`!). Then, for each of your clients, use `POST /billing_templates/{billing_template_id}/send_invoice/`.

    If the customer agrees to store his card for future purchases, then the next time the option to pay with a single click will appear if the payment channel supports tokenization.

    ***

    ## Subscriptions

    Subscriptions allow you to automate recurring purchases. You can create a subscription using the same request `POST /billing_templates/` as for invoices. To create a subscription billing template, specify `is_subscription: true` and `subscription_*` fields in `POST /billing_templates/` request body. Then, add subscribers using the `POST /billing_templates/<billing_template_id>/add_subscriber/` request.

    If the payment channel supports tokenization and the customer agreed to store his datafor future purchases, payments will be processed automatically, while the customer will get a receipt for each purchase. Note that whenever a subscription payment fails, your customer will automatically receive an invoice he can pay (and store a new card for upcoming payments in the process). Your system will also receive the `purchase.subscription_charge_failure` webhook event, if configured.

    By default, the system generates invoices and processes subscription payments at the beginning of the billing cycle.

    If you want to send an invoice or charge a customer at the end of the billing cycle, just set `subscription_charge_period_end` to `true` in `POST /billing_templates/` request.

    The API also provides you with an option to give a trial to your customers before enabling paid subscription period. To do that just set `subscription_trial_periods` in `POST /billing_templates/` request.

    # Callbacks

    Two methods for defining asynchronous callbacks are supported - `Purchase` success callbacks and webhooks.

    ## Purchase success callbacks

    `Purchase` success callbacks are defined by providing a target URL in the `success_callback` field on `Purchase` creation (see [POST /purchases/](#/Purchases/purchases_create)). The system will generate a callback when:
    * a `Purchase` with `skip_capture=false` is successfully paid;
    * a `Purchase` with `skip_capture=true` is successfully captured (see [POST /purchases/{id}/capture/](#/Purchases/purchases_capture));
    * a `Purchase` is successfully paid using a recurring token (see [POST /purchases/{id}/charge/](#/Purchases/purchases_charge));

    These callbacks pass a JSON-encoded `Purchase` as their payload. The payload represents a snapshot of the state of the `Purchase` when the event was created. The payload will include an `event_type` field to indicate which specific event (see [Event schema](#model-Event)) triggered the callback.

    The payload is signed using a company-wide key pair. You can obtain the public key with `GET /public_key/`. See the `Authentication` section below for more details.

    ## Webhooks

    For creating and modifying webhooks, see the Webhook [CRUD API specification](#operations-tag-Webhooks).

    `Webhook` callback payloads are signed using a dedicated key pair. You can obtain the public key from `Webhook.public_key`. See the [Authentication](#callback-auth) section below for more details.

    ## Delivery protocol

    When a callback is not successfully delivered (received by the target server and responded to with a 200 series HTTP response code), the system will make up to 8 additional attempts at exponentially increasing intervals between attempts. No further delivery attempts will be made if the callback is not successfully delivered 36 hours after triggering.

    Please note that due to the asynchronous nature of network requests, it is possible for a callback delivery confirmation (HTTP response with a 200 series status code) to not properly arrive from the callback's target server. Therefore it is possible in case of severe network faults for the target server to receive a callback, respond to it with a 200 series HTTP status code and then receive the same callback after an interval.

    Callback deliveries are guaranteed to be sequential to events triggered on their source objects. For example, when registering webhooks for both the `purchase.created` and `purchase.paid` events, there will be no `purchase.paid` callbacks for this `Purchase` until all `purchase.created` callbacks for this `Purchase` are successfully delivered.

    ## <b id="callback-auth">Authentication</b>

    Payloads are signed using asymmetric A.K.A. public-key cryptography to guarantee the authenticity of delivered callbacks. Each callback delivery request includes an X-Signature header field. This field contains a base64-encoded RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature of the SHA256 digest of the request body buffer.

    You can obtain the public key for `Webhook` authentication from `Webhook.public_key` of the corresponding `Webhook`.

    You can obtain the public key for success callback authentication from [GET /public_key/](#operations-Public_Key-public_key).

    Please note the provider is not responsible for any financial losses incurred due to not implementing payload signature verification.

        To run payments in your application use `POST /purchases/`, request to register payments and receive the checkout link (`checkout_url`). After the payment is processed, gateway will redirect the client back to your website (take note of `success_redirect`, `failure_redirect`).

        You have three options to check payment status: 1) use `success_callback` parameter of `Purchase` object; 2) use `GET /purchases/<purchase_id>/` request; 3) set up a Webhook using the UI or Webhook API to listen to `purchase.paid` or `purchase.payment_failure` event on your server.

        Using `skip_capture` flag allows you to separate the authentication and payment execution steps, allowing you to reserve funds on payer’s card account for some time. This flag can also enable preauthorization capability, allowing you to save the card without a financial transaction, if available.

        In case making a purchase client agrees to store his card for the upcoming purchases, next time he will be able to pay in a single click.

        Instead of a redirect you can also utilize Direct Post checkout: you can create an HTML `<form>` on your website with `method="POST"` and `action` pointing to `direct_post_url` of a created Purchase. You will also need to saturate form with `<input>`-s for card data fields. As a result, when a payer submits their card data, it will be posted straight to our system, allowing you to customize the checkout as you wish while your PCI DSS requirement is only raised to SAQ A-EP, as your system doesn't receive or process card data. For more details, see the documentation on Purchase's `direct_post_url` field.

        To pay for test Purchases, use `4444 3333 2222 1111` as the card number, `123` as CVC, any date/month greater than now as expiry and any (Latin) cardholder name. Any other card number/CVC/expiry not greater or equal than the current month will all fail a test payment.

        Charge a purchase using a `recurring_token` provided in the request body. Its value should be an `id` of a Purchase that has `is_recurring_token == true`. This purchase will be paid using the same method (e.g. same card) as the one used to pay the `recurring_token` purchase.

        If this operation takes too long to be processed on the acquirer side - you will get a response with status code 200 and a Purchase object having `status` = `pending_charge` in body (you will receive a corresponding Webhook callback too for a `purchase.pending_charge` event). To be notified of a successful operation completion, please subscribe to `purchase.paid` callback event - it will deliver an updated Purchase with `status` = `paid`. Alternatively, if charge fails, you will receive a `purchase.payment_failure` callback event.

        If recurring charge fails due to payment processing error, you will receive HTTP response code 400 with error code `purchase_charge_error`. In this case, to get more details about the error, you should perform a `GET /purchase/` request for the Purchase you tried to charge. In `transaction_data.attempts[]` array (newest element first) you'll find the corresponding attempt with error code and description in `.error` parameter.

      summary: Create a template to issue repeated invoices from in the future, with or without a subscription.
      description: |-
        BillingTemplate generates Purchase objects, either to issue one-time invoices or in a subscription.

        It does so by copying over its' `PurchaseDetails`, one of its `BillingTemplateClient`-s and generating other fields from BillingTemplate's fields as necessary into a new `Purchase` object.

        If `is_subscription` is `true`, it is considered to be a subscription's BillingTemplate. You will need to specify `subscription_*` fields like `subscription_period` when creating it and add BillingTemplateClient objects to its billing cycle (`POST /billing_templates/{id}/add_subscriber/`). After that the clients will receive recurring invoices (that will be paid for automatically if client saves their card) according to the BillingTemplate settings you have specified.

        If `is_subscription` is `false`, this BillingTemplate is used to send one-time invoices. After creating it and specifying `invoice_*` fields, use `POST /billing_templates/{id}/send_invoice/` request to send the actual invoices. BillingTemplateClients for non-subscription BillingTemplates are not saved.

      description: Use this request with a BillingTemplate having `is_subscription == false`. Specify the BillingTemplateClient data (only `client_id` field is needed) in the request body. The request will issue a Purchase by combining data of `BillingTemplate.purchase` and `BillingTemplateClient.client` and will send an invoice to your Client. Response will contain data of a created Purchase. The BillingTemplateClient will not be saved.

      description: |-
        Use this request with a BillingTemplate having `is_subscription == true`. Two scenarios are possible: 

        • If `subscription_charge_period_end == true` and/or `subscription_trial_periods > 0` (first billing should happen after 1 or more billing periods, not today), the request will create a BillingTemplateClient and start trial/schedule billing for it (as required by subscription settings). Successful response will be of form `{billing_template_client: <BillingTemplateClient object created>, purchase: null}`: no Purchase is created, `BillingTemplateClient.status` is `active` immediately. 

        • If `subscription_charge_period_end == false` and `subscription_trial_periods == 0` (first billing should occur today), the request will create a BillingTemplateClient with `status == pending` and create a Purchase. When such a Purchase is paid, the respective BillingTemplateClient will have its' subscription activated (starting from the day of payment), with its `status` changing to `active`. Successful response will be of form `{billing_template_client: <BillingTemplateClient object created>, purchase: <Purchase object created>}`: you should redirect your client to `purchase.checkout_url` for him to pay immediately (as you do with `POST /purchases/`).

    BillingTemplate:
      description: |-
        BillingTemplate generates Purchase objects, either to issue one-time invoices or in a subscription.

        It does so by copying over its' `PurchaseDetails`, one of its `BillingTemplateClient`-s and generating other fields from BillingTemplate's fields as necessary into a new `Purchase` object.

        If `is_subscription` is `true`, it is considered to be a subscription's BillingTemplate. You will need to specify `subscription_*` fields like `subscription_period` when creating it and add BillingTemplateClient objects to its billing cycle (`POST /billing_templates/{id}/add_subscriber/`). After that the clients will receive recurring invoices (that will be paid for automatically if client saves their card) according to the BillingTemplate settings you have specified.

        If `is_subscription` is `false`, this BillingTemplate is used to send one-time invoices. After creating it and specifying `invoice_*` fields, use `POST /billing_templates/{id}/send_invoice/` request to send the actual invoices. BillingTemplateClients for non-subscription BillingTemplates are not saved.

        Available event types and when they are emitted:

        `purchase.created`: Emitted when a Purchase is created. This happens as a result of POST /purchases/ request executed successfully or of any of the Billing API methods, including scheduled billing run by a BillingTemplate with is_subscription = true. Purchase.status will be == `created` in the received payload.

        ---

        `purchase.paid`: Emitted when a Purchase is paid for. Purchase.status will be == `paid`. Happens when a payform is submitted (for a Purchase having `skip_capture == false`) and a successful payment is done by the payer or in case of /capture/ or /charge/ API requests executed successfully.

        ---

        `purchase.payment_failure`: Emitted when payer submits a payment using the payform, but it doesn't complete successfully (e.g. because payer's account balance is insufficient). Purchase.status will be == `error`.

        ---

        `purchase.pending_execute`: Emitted when transaction execution takes longer than expected on the acquirer side. See `pending_execute` Purchase status. When transaction becomes finalized, a `purchase.paid`, `purchase.hold` or `purchase.payment_failed` callback will be emitted.

        ---

        `purchase.pending_charge`: Emitted when transaction execution takes longer than expected on the acquirer side. See `pending_charge` Purchase status. When transaction becomes finalized, a `purchase.paid` or `purchase.payment_failed` callback will be emitted.

        ---

        `purchase.cancelled`: Emitted once POST /purchases/{id}/cancel/ request succeeds. It won't be possible to pay for the related Purchase after that. Purchase.status will be == `cancelled`.

        ---

        `purchase.hold`: Emitted when a Purchase having `skip_capture == true` has its payform submitted and "payment" performed successfully. The specified amount of funds will be placed on hold. Purchase.status will be == `hold`.

        ---

        `purchase.captured`: Emitted when the POST /purchases/{id}/capture/ request for a Purchase that previously had the status of `hold` succeeds. Purchase.status will be == `paid`.

        ---

        `purchase.pending_capture`: Emitted when transaction execution takes longer than expected on the acquirer side. See `pending_capture` Purchase status. When transaction becomes finalized, a `purchase.captured` callback will be emitted.

        ---

        `purchase.released`: Emitted when the POST /purchases/{id}/release/ request for a Purchase that previously had the status of `hold` succeeds. Funds reserved will be released with no payment performed. Purchase.status will be == `released`.

        ---

        `purchase.pending_release`: Emitted when transaction execution takes longer than expected on the acquirer side. See `pending_release` Purchase status. When transaction becomes finalized, a `purchase.released` callback will be emitted.

        ---

        `purchase.preauthorized`: Emitted when preauthorization scenario (see description for the Purchase.skip_capture field) is executed successfully. Purchase will have a status of `preauthorized`.

        ---

        `purchase.recurring_token_deleted`: Emitted when the POST /purchases/{id}/delete_recurring_token/ request is executed successfully, deleting the recurring token associated with a Purchase. Purchase status will be the same as it were prior to this event.

        ---

        `purchase.pending_recurring_token_delete`: Emitted when token deletion takes longer than expected on the acquirer side. When operation is finalized, a `purchase.recurring_token_deleted` callback will be emitted.

        ---

        `purchase.subscription_charge_failure`: Emitted when an attempt to charge some Client's subscription-generated Purchase, using the token (e.g. card) they saved for their subscription, fails. Can only be emitted for a Purchase spawned from a BillingTemplate having is_subscription == true. Usually means the system can't charge the subscriber Client's card because e.g. their account balance is insufficient or card is expired, hence an invoice to be paid manually will be automatically mailed to them. Purchase.status in the returned payload will be == `sent`.

        ---

        `purchase.pending_refund`: Emitted when refund transaction execution takes longer than expected on the acquirer side. See `pending_refund` Purchase status. When refund becomes finalized, a `payment.refunded` callback will ne emitted.

        ---

        `payment.refunded`: Emitted when a Purchase is refunded (as a result of POST /purchases/{id}/capture/ request done successfully or action performed in company's frontoffice system). The returned data will be a Payment object generated as a result of this action. A link to the original Purchase (that will have a status of `refunded`) will be present in the `related_to` field of this Payment.

        ---

        `billing_template_client.subscription_billing_cancelled`: Emitted when a subscriber represented by this event's related BillingTemplateClient cancels their subscription using an email link available in the receipts he receives. The respective BillingTemplateClient will have its `status` set to `subscription_paused` as a result.

        ---

        `payout.pending`: Emitted when Payout execution has been initiated and is currently processing.

        ---

        `payout.failed`: Emitted when a Payout processing was completed with an error. Payout.status will be == `error`. Note that payouts can spend up to 3-5 days (depending on the payout provider) in processing after being initiated.

        ---

        `payout.success`: Emitted when a Payout is successfully processed. Payout.status will be == `success`. Note that payouts can spend up to 3-5 days (depending on the payout provider) in processing after being initiated.

            Card payment-specific: if set to true, only authorize the payment (place funds on hold) when payer enters his card data and pays. This option requires a `POST /capture/` or `POST /release/` later on. 

            You can use the preauthorization feature if you set this parameter to true and make the Purchase with `purchase.total == 0` (this can be achieved by providing a list of `purchase.products` with a total `price` of 0, or simply overriding the total using `purchase.total_override` to 0). The resulting Purchase can only be "paid" by the client (only cardholder data verification will happen, without a financial transaction) by card and will enforce saving the client's card. When this happens, the Purchase will have `status` of `preauthorized` and the `purchase.preauthorized` webhook callbacks will be emitted. 

            Trying to use skip_capture (or preauthorization) without any payment methods that support the respective actions (this can be a result of `payment_method_whitelist` field being used) will result in an error on Purchase creation request step. Please check the `GET /payment_methods/` response for your desired Purchase parameters and/or consult with your account manager.

            To leverage Direct Post checkout, create a `<form>` having `method="POST" action="<direct_post_url value>"` and include the following inputs:

            `cardholder_name: text, Latin letters only (space and apostrophe (`'`), dot (`.`), dash (`-`) symbols are also allowed), max 30 chars`

            `remember_card: checkbox with value="on" (the default when omitting value attribute of a checkbox input)`

            Ensure the validation as listed above! Validation errors will be treated as payment failures. Obviously, you can style this form to fit in with the rest of your website.

            When your payer submits this form (don't forget a `<button>` or `<input type="submit">`), he will POST the data directly to the gateway system. There, with minimal interaction with gateway's interface, payment will be processed. In the process, your customer might get redirected to authenticate against 3D Secure system of his card issuer bank (this depends on settings of his card and your account). After that, payer will be taken to `success_redirect` or `failure_redirect` depending on the payment result (as in the usual payment flow).

            Be aware, though, that while not having to process card data allows you not to comply with the entirety of PCI DSS SAQ D requirements, having sensitive cardholder data entry form on your website does raise your PCI DSS scope to SAQ A-EP. Contact your account manager to receive advisory and assistance for this integration method.

            The payload object will additionally include an "event_type" field to indicate which event type (see the Webhook.events field) triggered the webhook.

             Note that, as well as with the rest of dataset, test and live Webhooks are separate; test webhooks will not handle events caused by live Purchases, and vice-versa.
